## Overview
This program is designed to help users effectively prepare for their G1 driving test by offering a variety of practice options. Users can learn at their own pace by practicing individual topics through different modules. In addition to module-specific practice, users can simulate full G1 test experiences using our mimic test feature, which replicates the real test environment with timed sessions and randomized questions.

By offering both focused learning and realistic test simulations, this program provides a comprehensive way for users to build their confidence and knowledge, ensuring they are well-prepared to succeed in their G1 test.
