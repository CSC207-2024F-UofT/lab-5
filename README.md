## Preamble

Software Specifications:
This program allows users to either create a new account for a recipe organization system, or log in to their account
using existing user credentials. Users will be able to search for recipes and apply filters to narrow search results and
easily obtain recipes that appeal to them. Users save recipes to their profiles to better organize them and reference 
them for future use. Additionally, users may choose to review recipes that they have saved by providing a rating from
one to five, with one being the lowest and five being the highest, and an optional comment.
