***Wyatt’s Use Cases:***
- As a user, I want to leave a star rating and an optional written review for a specific movie, so that others can see my experience/thoughts on the movie.
  - To leave a review the user will have to first search the movie to access the movie screen boundary.
  - The user will then need to select “I watched this”
  - The “I watched this” window pane will then be updated to the “leave a review” button pane
  - If the user has already added this movie to their watchlist then the “leave a review” button pane will already be there.
  - This will call the controller to run the input boundary for the leave review use case.
  - The leave review use case input boundary will look as follows:
  - The user will be prompted with a text box for their written review (250 character max) (optional)  a star rating between 0 and 5 (required) and a back/home button (that will take them back to the homepage).
  - After completing their review they will hit submit.
  - The use case interactor will check if the star value is an integer between 0 and 5
  - If it is not an integer value between 0 and 5 return an error.
  - Otherwise, the use case interactor will trigger the leave review use case.
  - The leave review use case once called by the interactor will work as follows (we assume the necessary inputs have been provided) :  First check the reviewed object in our online database to see if the movie exists. If it does not exist under review then create a new movie object in our online database under movies and add to it the written review and star rating.
  - If successful, return “review created”.

- As a user, I want to view my past reviews that I have left for movie.
  - To view past reviews the user will click the “my reviews” button from the home screen. 
  - This will open the my reviews screen.
  - The screen will either show one of two things:
  - If the user has not left any review yet it will simply display a textbox stating so.
  - If the user has left reviews then they will be listed in a textbox with scroll enable along with the date posted.
  - Each review will be formatted in the textbox appropriately. 
  
- As a user, I want to see other people's written reviews for a specific movie and the average star rating for that movie.
  - On the movie screen there will be a button to select “user reviews”
  - This will call the controller to check if the movie exists in our online database
  - If it does not exist then return a message stating no reviews/ratings found.
  - If it does exist, have our use case interactor call the methods on the movie that return its star rating ( should be the average of all star ratings) and also the written reviews (formated appropriately)
  - Switch to display review output boundary and inject both the reviews and star rating provided by the view model into two panes. The first will be a scroll enabled text box with each review written separated by a full line in between each separate review (again this is provided by a method within the movie, if no written reviews exist write “no written reviews found”). The second will be 5 adjacent stars, filled up appropriately to represent the average star rating for the movie returned from the get ratings method which will be defined within the movie class.
  - There will also be a back button to return to the home screen.
