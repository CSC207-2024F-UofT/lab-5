# CSC 207 Project: Spotify Recommendation and Companion App

## Software Specification
The software will be made through Java Swing and act as an extension of a user’s Spotify account. 
This program that will visualize user listening patterns, 
suggest new or related songs for their preferences, search songs by certain 
lyrics and keywords that the user gives, and find users with similar preferences. 
It is going to be a general extension to the overall Spotify experience.
<br />
<br />
The APIs we will use are Spotify (to access user data) and OpenAI (to interpret data and recommend songs)

## Phase 1 Project Blueprint
We made six initial user stories; one for each of us to work on independently, and one to collaborate on as a team.
* John wants to sign in to / log out of the app (Team)

* John wants to get song recommendations based on his music preferences. He can click the “For You” button to get a 
list of recommendations based on his preferences. (Dimitrios)

* John wants to search songs by lyrics and artist. John can enter the artist's name and lyric keywords to find all 
songs by that artist that have those lyrics. (Quinn)

* John wants to see some songs based on a given keyword. John can enter the keyword into a search text box and get 
suggestions. (Ethan)

* John wants to see what his top tracks are. (Yanki)

* John wants to find other individuals that have a similar music preference. (Ksenia)
