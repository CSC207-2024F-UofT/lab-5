## Want To Contribute?
We welcome contributions to improve the software! If you're interested in contributing, please follow the steps below to ensure a smooth process.
1. **Fork the Repository**:  
   To start contributing, first fork the project’s repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to freely experiment and make changes without affecting the main codebase.

    - Go to the project repository on GitHub: [Project Repository](https://github.com/williamrygao/CSC207-Project)
    - Click the **Fork** button on the top right of the page.

2. **Clone the Fork**:  
   Once you've forked the project, clone your fork to your local machine to start working on the changes.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project.git
   cd project

3. **Create a New Branch**:  
   Always create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your work organized and makes it easier for us to review.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
4. **Make Your Changes**:  
   Now, make your changes to the codebase. Whether it's fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, make sure your changes align with the project's goals.

    - If you're fixing a bug, try to include a clear description of the bug and how your fix resolves it.
    - If you're adding a feature, ensure that it adds value to the project and aligns with the overall direction of the project.
    - If you're updating documentation, make sure it's clear, concise, and accurate.

   git commit -m "Description of the changes made"
6. **Push Your Changes**:
   Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch-name
7. **Create a Pull Request**:
   Once your changes are pushed, create a pull request from your fork to the main repository. You can do this by visiting your fork on GitHub and clicking the New Pull Request button. 
   Make sure your pull request is based on the latest version of the main branch (or whichever branch you're submitting to).
   Provide a clear description of what your pull request does and why it's important.
### Guidelines for Creating a Good Merge Request

To help ensure your contribution can be merged smoothly, please follow these guidelines:

- **Clarity**: Provide a detailed description of what your pull request does. If it fixes a bug, include the steps to reproduce the bug and how your changes fix it.
- **Consistency**: Follow the code style and structure used throughout the project. If you are unsure, refer to the existing code for guidance.
- **Testing**: Ensure that your changes don’t break any existing functionality. Run tests (if applicable) and add new tests for any new features or bug fixes.
- **Small Changes**: Where possible, submit small, focused changes. This makes it easier for the team to review and merge your contribution.

### Reviewing Contributions

Our project maintainers will review your pull request to ensure it aligns with the project goals, coding standards, and overall quality.

- **Code Review**: One or more maintainers will review your pull request. If necessary, they may suggest changes or improvements. Please be ready to make adjustments based on their feedback.
- **Tests**: We will run automated tests (if applicable) to verify that your changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Approval and Merge**: If your pull request passes review and tests, it will be approved and merged into the project. We may merge it directly or through a “squash and merge” method to keep the commit history clean.

### Contribution Protocols

- **Communication**: Always discuss larger changes with the team before starting. Use issues or the discussion board to propose new features or changes.
- **Respect for Others**: Be respectful and constructive in all communications. We want to foster a positive and collaborative environment for everyone.
- **Licensing**: Ensure that your contributions are your own work and that you have the right to submit them. By submitting a pull request, you agree to license your contributions under the project’s licensing terms.
