## User Stories
*	Member 1: The core feature of the program allows users to input ingredients they have on hand and receive recipe suggestions. Users can enter ingredients separated by commas, and the system will generate relevant recipes. If some ingredients are missing, the system can suggest close alternatives or highlight what else is needed. This feature helps users efficiently use the ingredients they already own, potentially reducing food waste and unnecessary shopping trips.

*	Member 2: A key component of the system is the ability for users to filter recipes by diet and cuisine. This feature allows users to customize results based on dietary needs—such as vegan, gluten-free, or keto—or by preferred cuisines like Italian or Mexican. Users can apply multiple filters simultaneously to find recipes that meet both dietary restrictions and taste preferences. Managing these filters effectively ensures that the results remain useful even when dietary and cultural preferences overlap.

*	Member 3: Another feature provides detailed nutritional information for each recipe. Users can click a button to access data such as calorie counts, macronutrients (carbs, proteins, fats), and other key nutrients. This feature supports those who are tracking their nutrition or following specific dietary goals. It is important for the system to present this information clearly, accounting for potential variations in portion sizes and ingredient substitutions.

*	Member 4: The system will also allow users to bookmark recipes for future reference. This feature enables users to save recipes they find interesting or useful and organize them into categories like "Dinner" or "Favorites." Additionally, a "Recently Viewed" section can help users retrieve recipes they forgot to bookmark. The ability to sync bookmarks across devices ensures easy access whether users are on a phone or computer.

*	Member 5: Finally, the program offers a shopping list feature for adjacent recipes. When users are missing one or two ingredients for a recipe, the system will generate a shopping list with only the required items. This function can help users decide what to buy if they want to try new meals without doing extensive shopping. Export options, such as saving the list as a PDF or sharing it with other apps, enhance usability. The system will also need to distinguish between essential ingredients and common pantry staples to keep the lists concise.
