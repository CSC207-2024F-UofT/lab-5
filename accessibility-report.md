# Accessibility Report 

## Principle of Universal Design


### Principle 1: Equitable Use
While the program is designed to be inclusive by offering adaptive learning features, 
it could further incorporate features to ensure equitable use for individuals with disabilities. 
For example, adding text-to-speech or adjustable text sizes could make the program more accessible to users
with visual impairments or learning disabilities.

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
The program allows users to practice at their own pace through different 
modules and provides adaptive learning via test simulations. 
This flexibility accommodates users with varying levels of knowledge and learning speeds.

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
The program is designed with a simple, user-friendly interface that allows users to easily 
navigate through different modules and tests. However, further enhancements, such as 
incorporating tooltips or a more detailed help section, could improve the overall intuitiveness for first-time users.

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
The program offers immediate, clear feedback by displaying a list of incorrectly answered questions 
after each test. This allows users to easily track their progress, identify areas for improvement, 
and make necessary adjustments, fostering an understanding of where they need to focus their efforts to improve.

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
By providing detailed feedback on mistakes and offering users the chance to 
revisit questions they answered incorrectly, the program creates a supportive environment 
where errors are not discouraged but viewed as learning opportunities. This approach encourages users 
to try again without fear of failure, promoting resilience and improving the overall learning experience.

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
The program currently does not require physical effort to interact with, as users engage with it through
keyboard inputs and mouse clicks. However, implementing voice commands or alternative input methods could be
a useful feature for users with physical disabilities or those who prefer hands-free interaction.

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
Since the program is designed to be used on devices like computers or tablets, it accommodates a wide range of user 
preferences. However, ensuring the program is optimized for accessibility in terms of screen size adjustments or mobile 
versions could help users with different physical environments or those who have limited access to larger screens.

## Target Audience
1. If we were to market this program, we would target individuals who are preparing for the ***G1 driving test***, 
specifically **young adults** or **first-time drivers**. This demographic is likely to appreciate the structured learning 
environment, modular practice, and mock test features that help them familiarize themselves with the test format.

2. Additionally, the program could appeal to people who prefer self-paced learning, such as busy college students or 
working adults who need flexibility in how and when they study. The adaptability of the program, with features like 
test result feedback, would also attract users who are motivated by continuous improvement and tracking their progress.

## Demographic Accessibility and Ethical Considerations
1. While the program is designed to be flexible and accessible, it may be less likely to be used by certain 
demographics, such as **older adults** who may not be as comfortable with digital platforms or those with limited access to 
technology. 

2. Additionally, individuals with **visual** or **cognitive impairments** may struggle with the program if it lacks features 
like screen reader compatibility, adjustable text sizes, or voice commands. As discussed in our ethics modules, 
accessibility should be a priority to ensure that no group is unfairly excluded, and future development should focus 
on adding features that cater to users with disabilities or those who face technological barriers. Ensuring equitable 
access for all potential users is crucial to creating a truly inclusive product.
