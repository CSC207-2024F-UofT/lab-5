## 1. Principles of universal design:
  Principle 1. Equitable Use 
The app offers identical core features, such as creating lists, reviewing films, and exploring content recommendations,
to all users, ensuring equal access regardless of ability. It avoids segregating users by maintaining an inclusive design, 
where customization options and accessibility features, such as screen reader compatibility, enhance usability for individuals 
with diverse needs. Additionally, privacy settings are available to all users, fostering a secure and equitable experience.
In the future, adding posters would make our program more flexibility to those with visual impairments.  Posters allow for 
different visual data as compared to text. This would allow for more visual information, making recogntion easier. Additonally, 
we would add an alternative text feature for the poster, which many readers for visual aid use.

  Principle 2. Flexibility in Use
The app allows users to name their watchlists freely, accommodating diverse preferences and organizational styles. This 
flexibility ensures users can personalize their experience, enhancing ease of use and satisfaction regardless of their naming 
conventions or creative approaches. Additionally, it empowers users to manage their watchlists at their own pace and with their 
preferred level of precision.

  Principle 3. Simple and intuitive use
We have made the user interface of our application simple and intuitive. There are no unnecessary buttons. Buttons have clear 
labels and also have different colors.  When a user performs an action they get a confirmation either explicitly  in the form 
of a message or in the form of UI reflecting the change (e. g. buttons look different and activate / deactivate, watchlist appears 
in the list when it is created).

  Principle 4. Perceptible Information
The views use big and clear fonts for view names, so users understand where they are within the app. Labels are easy to read, 
and they explain what each feature does, making the app simple to use for everyone.

  Principle 5. Tolerance for error
When a user wants delete a watchlist or remove a movie from a watchlist a confirmation message appears. If a user misspells
a name of a watchlist they can rename it. 

  Principle 6. Low physical  effort
Using our application requires very little physical effort. We provided home and  back buttons to make our app easy to navigate.

  Principle 7. Size and space for approach and use
This principle doesn't apply to our application as there is no physical component to it. 

## 2. Target audience 
The audience for our application is people who like movies. It is for movie fans that want keep track of the movies they have 
watched and share their opinions about them, as well as to make plans for what movies they want to see in the future. Right now 
our application is only available  in English, but we plan to make it available in other languages in the future.

## 3. People less likely to use our program 
Our program is most likely to be used by english speakers. People without access to technology or people without access to the 
internet cannot use our program because it requires an internet connection to connect to the DB. Also people who do not enjoy 
movies would not benefit from using our program.
