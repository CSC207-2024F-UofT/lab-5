# Principles of Universal Design

## Equitable Use
“The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities”
- A computer mouse, touchpad or touch-screen device can be used to navigate the application, making it usable to people of different abilities. Individuals who may not have the fine motor skills associated with using a computer mouse will still be able to use the application to its full capabilities using a touch screen.

## Flexibility in Use
“The design accommodate a wide range of individual preferences and abilities”
- Currently, the application on its own does not support full flexibility of use, however a user may still be able to utilize accessibility features built into their personal electronic devices to facilitate speech-to-text functionality or manually increase the font size or zoom in.

## Simple and Intuitive Use
“Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills or current concentration level”
- Directions are given in simple, non-technical language. The flow of the application is logical and cohesive and the sequence of views that a user engages with is intuitive to follow. Prompts and text labels are also provided for additional clarity.

## Perceptible Information
“The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or user’s sensory abilities”
- Non technical language with appropriate prompts, labels and error messages. While this may be adequate, it can be further improved by using colour to reflect different functionalities (for example, having “back” and “cancel” buttons in red and “search” and “save” buttons in green).

## Tolerance for Error
“The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions”
- The back button and cancel buttons
- However, once a change is made it cannot be undone. This can be improved by implementing an “undo” or “edit” functionality for features such as reviewing a recipe. Furthermore, a “forgot password” feature can be added so that users will not lose access to their account and saved recipes even if they are unable to remember their login credentials.

## Low Physical Effort
“The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue”
- The application is quite straightforward and does not require excessive button clicks to navigate to different views and features, which reduces the physical effort exerted by the user. However, this principle can be improved upon further by increasing the size of the buttons to make them more easily clickable.

## Size and Space for Approach and Use
“Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation and use regardless of user’s body size, posture, or mobility”
- The main frame of the application can be made larger and depending on the device on which the software is being used, the user may also be able to zoom in on parts of the frame they wish to see better. However, this is mostly dependent on the user’s device rather than the software itself. This principle can be improved upon by implementing a feature that allows the user to enlarge the size of the panels on the frame rather than manually zoom in.



# Intended Users
For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
