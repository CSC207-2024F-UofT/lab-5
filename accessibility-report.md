## Principles of Universal Design

### Equitable Use
“The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities”
- A computer mouse, touchpad or touch-screen device can be used to navigate the application, making it usable to people of different abilities.
- Individuals who may not have the fine motor skills necessary for using a computer mouse will still be able to use the application to its full capabilities using a touch screen.

### Flexibility in Use
“The design accommodate a wide range of individual preferences and abilities”
- Currently, the application on its own does not support full flexibility of use, however a user may still be able to utilize accessibility features built into their personal electronic devices to facilitate speech-to-text functionality, manually increase the font size or zoom in to improve their experience using the application.

### Simple and Intuitive Use
“Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills or current concentration level”
- Simple, non-technical langauge is used to communicate instructions to the user, so that prompts, labels and messages can be easily understood by anyone, regardless of their level of experience with technology.
- The flow of the application is logical and cohesive, and the sequence of views that a user engages with is particulary intuitive. Prompts and text labels are also provided for additional clarity.

### Perceptible Information
“The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or user’s sensory abilities”
- Non-technical language with appropriate prompts, labels and error messages.
- While this may be adequate for our purposes, the project can be further improved by using colour to reflect different functionalities. For example, having “back” and “cancel” buttons in red and “search” and “save” buttons in green may make the buttons' functionality clearer to the user and prevent accidental mis-clicks.

### Tolerance for Error
“The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions”
- The "back" buttons and "cancel" buttons allow a user to exit the program in the event that they wish to restart after making a mistake.
- However, once a change is made it cannot be undone. This aspect can be improved upon by implementing an “undo” or “edit” functionality for features such as reviewing a recipe.
- Furthermore, a “forgot password” feature can be added so that users will not lose access to their account and saved recipes, even if they are unable to remember their login credentials.

### Low Physical Effort
“The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue”
- The application is quite straightforward and does not require excessive button clicks to navigate to different views and features, which reduces the physical effort exerted by the user.
- However, this principle can be improved upon further by increasing the size of the buttons to make them more easily clickable.

### Size and Space for Approach and Use
“Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation and use regardless of user’s body size, posture, or mobility”
- The main frame of the application can be made larger and depending on the device on which the software is being used, the user may also be able to zoom in on parts of the frame they wish to see better.
- However, this is largely dependent on the user’s device rather than the software itself. This principle can be improved upon by implementing a feature that allows the user to enlarge the size of the panels and/or text on the frame rather than manually zoom in.
