Principles of Universal Design
	1.	Equitable Use
	•	Our “search songs by description” feature is useful for users with diverse preferences, such as those who may not remember a song title but can describe its theme or mood.
	•	In the future, we could ensure all features are accessible to screen readers so users with visual impairments can benefit equally.
	2.	Flexibility in Use
	•	Users can search for songs using either keywords or artist names, providing flexibility based on their preferences or the information they have.
	•	Features like “get song recommendations based on your music preferences” adapt to the user’s individual music taste, offering personalized results.
	3.	Simple and Intuitive Use
	•	The interface for searching songs and getting recommendations will be designed with clear buttons and instructions, making it easy for first-time users to navigate.
	•	We could implement a guided onboarding process to explain each feature briefly to ensure users understand how to use the program effectively.
	4.	Perceptible Information
	•	We could provide visual cues (e.g., icons for search and recommendations) alongside textual labels for clarity.
	•	In the future, adding audio feedback or haptic signals for critical actions could further ensure the program communicates effectively to users with varying sensory abilities.
	5.	Tolerance for Error
	•	When searching for songs, the program allows partial matches or spelling mistakes, reducing the chance of user frustration from errors.
	•	Features like “get similar artists” and “get top tracks” are forgiving if a user does not know specific song titles or artist names, broadening the scope of results.
	6.	Low Physical Effort
	•	The program minimizes effort by enabling users to perform all tasks with a few clicks or taps, such as retrieving top tracks or similar artists in one action.
	•	We could implement voice commands in the future to allow hands-free operation, further reducing physical effort.
	7.	Size and Space for Approach and Use
	•	The interface will be designed with large, clickable buttons and clear spacing to accommodate users with limited dexterity or those using touchscreen devices.
	•	Future versions could include customizable font sizes and layouts to improve usability for individuals with visual impairments or different screen sizes.

Marketing the Program

Our program, Spotify Companions, would be marketed primarily to music enthusiasts who seek a more personalized and engaging experience with their music library. This includes individuals who enjoy discovering new music, exploring similar artists, or curating playlists based on mood or preferences. Students, professionals, and casual listeners alike would benefit from features like keyword searches and recommendations, as these streamline the process of finding music that resonates with them. Additionally, by leveraging Spotify’s existing user base, our program appeals to a wide demographic of people who already interact with music streaming services.

Demographics Less Likely to Use the Program

Certain demographics might be less likely to use our program, particularly those who are not active users of Spotify or other music streaming services. People unfamiliar with digital music platforms or those with limited internet access may find the program less appealing or accessible. Moreover, users with disabilities such as visual impairments might face challenges if we do not implement accessibility features like screen reader compatibility or alternative input methods. To address this, we should prioritize accessibility considerations in our design, ensuring that the program does not unintentionally exclude users from diverse backgrounds. This aligns with the principles of ethical software design and inclusivity discussed in our embedded ethics modules.
