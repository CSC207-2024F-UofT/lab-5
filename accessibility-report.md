# Accessibility Report

## Question 1
*For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:*   

*(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or*  
*(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.*

### Principle 1: Equitable Use
- this software can be accessed from any smart device - it does not require any special hardware or plugins
- we can potentially find an API that allows users to download the entire database of recipes, so that those without connection to internet can still use the software
### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
- there are not a lot of parameters that a user can change currently...
### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- the design of the software is quite minimal, and all the buttons, text fields and dropdown menus are labelled
- since it does not have explicit instructions, this software might require the user to have some experience with softwares in general (and features such as signing in, searching and bookmarking). We can improve this by adding a user manual on the welcome page
### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
- this software has the potential of being incorporated with screen readers, so that it is accessible to those with vision impairments
- in the future, we can add settings that allow users to adjust font size and background colour
### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
- right now, empty entries on the login/signup and search pages would not crash the program
- in the future, we can incorporate an autocorrect feature into the search function, so that users can still get results if they do not know how to spell an ingredient correctly 
### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- this software is inclusive because it does not require a lot of physical effort to use
- the shopping list feature can potentially be connected to grocery delivery services, so users who cannot purchase groceries themselves can still benefit from the recipe generator
### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
- not applicable here since the software is not connect to any hardware  

## Question 2
*Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.*  

This software could be market towards a variety of users who have a similar need - to find recipes based on the ingredients
they had on hand. Users might seek out this program for a variety of reasons: for example, university students learning to cook
would find it useful, since they might not know what dishes can be made from the ingredients they have. They are also likely
to need instructions when cooking, which the software can provide by opening details of recipes in a browsers. This software 
could also be helpful for busy professionals or parents who are too busy for meal planning. They can use the software to find 
last-minute recipes they can make. People exploring new cuisines and recipes can also benefit from this software, since it 
provides features like filtering by cuisines. Finally, this software is useful to those on special diets or are conscious about
nutrition, since it allows users to filter recipes by diet and view the nutrition breakdown of each recipe.

## Question 3  
*Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.*  

This software could be challenging to use by older people who are not familiar with technology or who might prefer traditional
recipes. They might suffer more tangible harm from the lack of access to practical recipes, since it is more likely for them to 
have mobility impairments and thus a more limited stock of ingredients. Those with visual impairments might also have difficulty
using the software, since it does not currently have features such as speech-to-text and alternate captions, which allow for 
hands-free usage. This is an intervention that stems from a social model of disability, since it would also allow users to use
the software when their hands are occupied with cooking. Furthermore, the software might not be favoured by people form cultural
groups whose cuisines are not well-represented in the recipe database from Spoonacular. This potentially causes relational harm, 
since users from those cultural groups might feel like their cuisines are marginalized. A similar reasoning applies for users
with religious dietary restrictions, since there are no filters for categories such as halal and kosher.
