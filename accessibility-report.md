# Accessibility Report

## Question 1
For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:   

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or  
(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

### Principle 1: Equitable Use
- this software can be accessed from any smart device - it does not require any special hardware or plugins
- we can potentially find an API that allows users to download the entire database of recipes, so that those without connection to internet can still use the software
### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
- there are not a lot of parameters that a user can change currently...
### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- the design of the software is quite minimal, and all the buttons, text fields and dropdown menus are labelled
- since it does not have explicit instructions, this software might require the user to have some experience with softwares in general (and features such as signing in, searching and bookmarking). We can improve this by adding a user manual on the welcome page
### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
- this software has the potential of being incorporated with screen readers, so that it is accessible to those with vision impairments
- in the future, we can add settings that allow users to adjust font size and background colour
### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
- right now, empty entries on the login/signup and search pages would not crash the program
- in the future, we can incorporate an autocorrect feature into the search function, so that users can still get results if they do not know how to spell an ingredient correctly 
### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- this software is inclusive because it does not require a lot of physical effort to use
- the shopping list feature can potentially be connected to grocery delivery services, so users who cannot purchase groceries themselves can still benefit from the recipe generator
### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
- not applicable here since the software is not connect to any hardware  


*(for Q2 and 3, just wrote down some bullet points for now)*

## Question 2
- university students learning to cook
- busy parents who are too busy for meal planning
- people looking to explore new cuisines and recipes
- athletes who are conscious about nutrition

## Question 3  
Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
- older people living alone who are not familiar with technology, or are more familiar with traditional recipes
- people from cultural groups whose cuisines are not represented in the recipe database
- people with religious dietary restrictions (no filters for halal, kosher, etc.)
