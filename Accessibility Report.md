## Universal Principles of Design in Relation to Our Project

### **1. Equitable Use**
Equitable use ensures that a design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. In our recipe management system, we strive to make the application accessible to as many users as possible, including those with varying levels of experience and physical abilities. For instance:
- The interface features large, clearly labeled buttons for actions like "Search Recipes" and "Generate Shopping List," making it intuitive for users with limited technical expertise.
- Recipes are presented in a clean, uncluttered format that avoids overwhelming users with unnecessary visual elements, which benefits users with cognitive disabilities or attention difficulties.

By adhering to the principle of equitable use, we aim to provide a design that accommodates the needs of our target audience while remaining usable for individuals with diverse abilities.

### **2. Simple and Intuitive Use**
This principle emphasizes that the design should be easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, or language skills. To achieve this:
- The application uses familiar design patterns, such as dropdown menus for selecting categories and auto-complete functionality in the search bar, to minimize the learning curve for new users.
- Clear instructions and icons are provided throughout the application to guide users, ensuring that even individuals with minimal technical expertise can navigate the system confidently.

By focusing on simplicity and intuitiveness, we ensure that users, including those with limited digital literacy, can quickly learn and efficiently use the application to organize their recipes and shopping lists.

## Target Audience
The primary users of this application are **cooking enthusiasts and home chefs** who want to efficiently organize recipes, manage favorites, and create shopping lists. These users prioritize functionality, simplicity, and ease of use.

## Groups That May Face Challenges
Despite our efforts, some groups may face challenges using the application:
1. **Visually Impaired Users:** Currently, the interface lacks full compatibility with screen readers and high-contrast color modes, which limits accessibility for users with visual impairments.
2. **Users Without Internet Access:** Some features, such as cloud storage integration, require internet connectivity, excluding users in areas with limited or no access to the internet.

### Future Improvements
To make the application more inclusive, we plan to:
- Implement screen reader support and high-contrast themes for visually impaired users.
- Introduce offline functionality for recipe storage and shopping list generation, ensuring accessibility for users in all environments.
