/**
 * The EditState class is designed to represent the state of the editing process.
 * This class serves as part of the interface adapter layer, following the Clean Architecture principles.
 * Its purpose is to encapsulate and manage the state information specific to the editing functionality.
 * This state can include flags, statuses, or any other information required to track the progress
 * or result of an edit operation.
 * Currently, this class is empty, but it acts as a placeholder for future expansion,
 * where various fields or methods could be added to support more complex state management.

    // This class is currently empty but serves as a placeholder for managing edit states in the future.
    // Possible future additions:
    // - Boolean flags indicating if an edit operation is in progress or completed.
    // - Enum or String fields for tracking the result of an edit (e.g., SUCCESS, FAILURE).
    // - Methods for resetting, updating, or querying the state of the editing process.
