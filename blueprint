Project Specification for Group # 195
Team Name: Osiris
Domain:
The domain of our software is personal finance management, focusing on
helping users manage their finances using Open Banking APIs. The broad
purpose of the proposed software is to provide an easy-to-use platform for users
to view and manage their personal finances, including tracking expenses,
budgeting, and accessing various bank account data through Open Banking
APIs. This software aims to assist users in gaining better control over their
financial health and making informed financial decisions. We chose this domain
because it would be very beneficial to students who struggle to manage their
finances.
Software Specification:
The program allows users to connect their bank accounts securely using Open Banking
APIs to retrieve transaction and balance information. Users can track their expenses by
categorizing their spending patterns, set budgets for various categories, and visualize
their financial data through charts or graphs. The software also provides a way to save
financial reports, helping users analyze their financial health over time. Users can
customize budget categories, spending limits, and financial goals to tailor the experience
to their needs.
User Stories:
1. A student needs to view all their bank transactions in one place. They connect their
bank accounts through the Plaid API, allowing them to have a consolidated view of their
finances, as it would be tedious to look through all their statements and accounts.
2. Shah wants to understand his spending habits better. He uses the platform to
categorize his expenses and track where his money is going.
3. Mahan wants to start saving money to invest. He sets budgets for different spending
categories, allowing him to stay on track and set money aside to invest.
4. Divnoor wants to visualize his spending trends. He uses the software to view graphs
and charts of his spending patterns over the last few months.
5. Parsh wants to save his financial data to review later. He generates a financial report
that he can export and analyze.
